## Description
python.ForceBundle is a python implementation of [Force-directed Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse557/readings/holten-edgebundling.pdf), which trough organic bundling of edges, make easy to visualize patterns on otherwise visually clutter diagrams.


## Quick start
Download ```ForcedirectedEdgeBundling.py``` to you project dir, and use it like this:
```python
# Not really working like this yet
import networkx as nx
import ForcedirectedEdgeBundling as feb

mygraph = nx.read_gml("path.to.file")
input_edges = feb.net2edges(mygraph)
output_lines = feb.forcebundle(input_edges)
bundled_graph = feb.lines2net(output_lines)
bundled_graph.plot()
```

Check ```example.ipynb``` for a full functional example from data to plot.

## Parameters Tuning
### Fixed Parameters 
A certain number of parameters have been fixed to specific optimized values as found through experimentation by the authors. These include the spring constants **K** (=0.1), which controls the amount of bundling by controling the stiffness of edges. The number of iterations for simulating force interactions **I** (=60) and the number of cycles of subdivision-force simulation iterations **C** (=6). Moreover, the initial number of division points **P** is set to 1 and the rate at which it increases set to 2. The rate of the number of iterations **I** decreases each cycle is set to **2/3**.
All these parameters can be changed nonetheless if really needed by using the following methods:

- *bundling_stiffness ([new bundling stiffness: float value])*
- *iterations([new number of iterations to execute each cycle: int value])*
- *iterations_rate([new decrease rate for iteration number in each cycle: float value])*
- *cycles ([new number of cycles to execute: int value])*
- *subdivision_points_seed([new number subdivision points in first cycle: int value])*
- *subdivision_rate([new rate of subdivision each cycle: float value])*

### Tuning Parameters For Your Specific Graph

Two parameters are **essential** for tuning the algorithm to produce usable diagrams for your graph. These are the geometric **compatibility score** above which pairs of edges should be considered compatible (default is set to 0.6, 60% compatiblity). The value provided should be between 0 and 1. Passing the new value to the  ***compatbility_threshold*** method will set the new threshold.

The **most important parameter** is the **initial step size** used to move the subdivision points after forces have been computed. This depends on both the scale of the graph and the number of edges and nodes contained. Having a step size which is too low will produce node-link like graphs while too high values will over distort edges. This can be set using the ***step_size*** function and passing your new step float size value. The default value is set to **0.1**.

## Contrib & Issues
If you want to contrib, just fork and PR.

If you found a bug, open issue with a [minimal, complete, verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

## Debugging
### Fixing crashes checklist

 - Be sure you edges are going trough ```is_long_enough(edge)``` or an equibalent (if you using ```array2edges```, it does it for you)
 - May be the float point:
    1. Set ```FASTMATH=False```
    2. If still fails try replacing jit spec at ```Point``` class from: 
    
        ```Python
        @jitclass([('x', float32), ('y', float32)])
        ```
        to:
            
        ```Python
        @jitclass([('x', float64), ('y', float64)])
        ```

### Execution flow chart
If you are confused about the execution order of each function, check the [execution flow chart](doc_assets/Force-directedEdgeBundling.png).

### General debugging advice 
[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) function are opaque and big datasets are slow to process without. Mi advice is to attack on both fronts:

 1. Try to slice you edges until you you have a reasonable amount to process without numba , something like:
    ```Python
     slide = data[:1000]
     # If doesn't crash then try:
     slide = data[1000:2000] 
     ```
 2. Go commenting the ````@jit```` line on the chain of functions until you find the issue on plain python


## beloved _js_ ancestor
This implementation it's a port to _numba_ from un-usably-slow native _python_ implementation which was a port of [a _d3 js_ implementation](https://github.com/upphiminn/d3.ForceBundle).

I tried to keep structure as close as possible, so bug fixes can be easily ported in both ways.
